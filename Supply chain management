Definition:
Supply chain management (SCM) is the broad range of activities required to plan, control and execute a product's flow, 
from acquiring raw materials and production through distribution to the final customer, in the most streamlined and 
cost-effective way possible.

SCM encompasses the integrated planning and execution of processes required to optimize the flow of materials, information 
and financial capital in the areas that broadly include 
demand planning, sourcing, production, inventory management and  storage, transportation or logistics and return for excess or 
defective products. 


Benefits of supply chain management
Supply chain management creates efficiencies, raises profits, lowers costs, boosts collaboration and more. SCM enables companies
to better manage demand, carry the right amount of inventory, deal with disruptions, keep costs to a minimum and meet customer 
demand in the most effective way possible. These SCM benefits are achieved through the appropriate strategies and software to 
help manage the growing complexity of today's supply chains.
